# AluraBooks

**This project was developed in the [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/) course, [*HTML e CSS: responsividade com mobile-first*](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html-css-responsividade-mobile-first).**

**ðŸ’» What did we do in the project?**
- We only focus on delving deeper into HTML and CSS;
- We worked a little with Semantic Tags and understood their importance in organizing our code;
- We work with DevTools;
- We deepen our knowledge about FlexBox;
- We learned some ways to do imports;
- We use a JavaScript library, [***Swiper JS***](https://swiperjs.com/), was used to develop the carousel with the books;
- We implement Pseudo-Class and Combinators in CSS;
- We made the site responsive, using Media Queries (***min-width:1024px and min-width:1728px***) and understanding how they work;
